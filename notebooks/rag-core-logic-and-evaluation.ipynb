    "| # | Question | Generated Answer | Retrieved Sources | Quality Score | Comments/Analysis |\n",
    "|---|----------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| 1 | Why are customers unhappy with BNPL(buy now pay later) services? | Customers are unhappy with BNPL services due to a lack of consistency in reporting standards, lack of transparency in pricing and fees, and exploitative marketing practices. These issues lead to financial and emotional burden for customers, with no concern for customer satisfaction or urgency to resolve issues. The CFPB is also investigating unfair practices in the BNPL sector. | - \"2. lack of consistent reporting standards...\"<br>- \"i don’t know what’s going on with companies no...\" | **4** | The model surfaced key themes like transparency and poor service with reasonable grounding. Some phrasing (e.g. “exploitative marketing”) is a bit strong compared to retrieved content. No direct use of exact phrases, but the grouping of issues feels aligned. Including a reference to the CFPB adds useful framing, though it might stretch slightly beyond the context. |\n",
    "| 2 | What issues do people commonly report about credit cards? | People commonly report issues such as poor customer service, incorrect account management, high interest rates and fees, unjustified limit decreases, and lack of flexibility in policies. | - \"I have used many credit cards, and I have never...\"<br>- \"And some other issues concerning the users c...\" | **5** | The answer captures multiple complaint themes with clear structure and matches the context. Well balanced, concise, and relevant. |\n",
    "| 3 | Are there shared complaints between personal loans and savings accounts? | Customers report shared complaints between personal loans and savings accounts, including confusion over advertised loan programs tied to savings products and improper handling of accounts post-bankruptcy. These concerns reflect misleading expectations and lack of transparency across both product types. | - \"I had a Wells Fargo checking and savings account...\"<br>- \"I have several savings accounts with them...\" | **4** | The response captures multi-product friction clearly. Condensed well, though chunk phrasing could be mirrored more closely for improved grounding. |\n",
    "| 4 | What problems do consumers face when using money transfer services? | - Inconvenient or undocumented transfers<br>- Weak customer protection policies<br>- Difficulty resolving transfer issues<br>- Reliability concerns with services like Zelle<br>- Risks of fraud and lost funds | - \"Overall, these issues highlight a potential...\"<br>- \"That can mean anything. Anyone’s guess could...\" | **4** | Clearly organized categories with solid topical coverage. Slight generalization in tone, and some phrasing lacks direct grounding in excerpts. |\n",
    "| 5 | How do customers feel about repayment options on personal loans? | - Repayment options are inflexible and burdensome<br>- High interest rates can mislead borrowers<br>- Customers often feel confused and frustrated by loan terms | - \"It doesn't help a customer to repay a $ loan...\"<br>- \"I put in for a personal loan not knowing that...\" | **5** | Answer reflects key frustrations with strong context alignment. Clear phrasing and well-structured summary. |\n",
    "| 6 | Is there evidence of misleading communication in BNPL or credit card services? | BNPL companies have been criticized for inconsistent reporting of payment history, which may misrepresent consumer creditworthiness. Credit card complaints include concerns about lack of transparency when dispute-related evidence is handled only by the provider, undermining trust and clarity. | - \"2. lack of consistent reporting standards...\"<br>- \"This sequence constitutes deceptive or misle...\" | **5** | Strong alignment with context and regulatory implications. Clear structure and factual phrasing add credibility. |\n",
    "| 7 | What patterns of frustration emerge from savings account complaints? | Customers express deep frustration with savings account services, often citing dismissive and unhelpful responses from support teams. They report feeling helpless and mistrusted, especially when errors caused by bank employees are redirected back onto them. Many describe being deprived of access to their own money for extended periods, leading to financial stress and accumulating interest charges. Some accounts reveal perceived discrimination — particularly against vulnerable groups like senior citizens — and the loss of trust when institutions fail to communicate transparently or resolve complaints compassionately. | - \"Chronically incompetent or pretentious compl...\"<br>- \"As I stated, English is not my native langua...\" | **4** | Thorough and issue-rich, with strong emotional signals. Could benefit from tighter grouping and more direct quotation of user phrasing. |\n",
    "| 8 | Why do people dispute fees on money transfer platforms? | - Hidden fees baked into exchange rates<br>- Failed or delayed transfers triggering extra costs<br>- Poor customer support and unclear communication<br>- Lost incentives from unsuccessful referral-linked transfers<br>- Erosion of trust due to unresolved disputes | - \"I read about the complaints other people has...\"<br>- \"They just want to wash their hands of it and...\" | **4** | Covers key drivers of fee disputes with solid structure. Slightly verbose in places, but aligns well with retrieved frustration themes. |\n",
    "| 9 | Do loan customers mention any difficulties during the application process? | Loan customers report system glitches and unclear or inconsistent information from bank representatives as key issues during the application process. These problems lead to confusion, delays, and diminished trust in the institutions. | - \"In both instances, I was told I was approved...\"<br>- \"Very bad service, the representative or so-called...\" | **4** | Clear summary of pain points with concise grounding. Could incorporate more direct phrase usage for stronger contextual anchoring. |"
